## Coding Exercises

* *fibonacci.py* - Taking user input from the terminal, get the nth number from the Fibonacci sequence using three different methods (iteratively, recursively, and in constant time using Binet's formula) and compare how long each method takes.
* *fizzbuzz.rb* - Inspired by the former British schoolchildren's game and current basic software developer interview question, for numbers from 1 to 100, print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it is divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, and just print the number if none of the above are true.
* *histogram.rb* - Taking a sentence or paragraph from user input to the terminal, create a frequency map or histogram of words used in the text, sorted by how often each word is used, descending.
* *pig_latin.py* - Taking words from user input to the terminal, print out the word converted into Pig Latin, where the first cluster of consonants is moved to the end of the word, and "ay" is added to the end result (Dance -> Anceday, String -> Ringstray).
* *reverse_string.py* - Taking user input from the terminal, reverse strings using three different methods (using built-in methods for a single string, iterating over each character, iterating over each sentence).
